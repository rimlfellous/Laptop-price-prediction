In this project, I built a machine learning model to estimate laptop prices based on key specifications such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, screen size, and graphics card. 

The preprocessing phase included handling missing values, encoding categorical features (e.g., brand and processor type) using one-hot encoding, and scaling numerical features like RAM and storage using Min-Max scaling to ensure the model treated all features appropriately.

I experimented with multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing algorithm. 

Gradient Boosting ultimately provided the most accurate predictions due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships. The dataset was split into training and test sets, with an 80-20 split, and the model achieved an RÂ² score of approximately 88% on the test set. 

Additionally, I incorporated feature importance analysis to identify the most influential features, which helped explain how factors like processor and brand significantly impacted price. This project deepened my understanding of supervised learning, feature engineering, and the evaluation of regression models. 

It also taught me how to manage the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability when working on real-world datasets.
